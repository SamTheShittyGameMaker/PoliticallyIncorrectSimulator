# PoliticallyIncorrectSimulator
A Game for People Tired about Politically Correctness

Game setting: 
* A 2D pixelated world (simple world, simple mechanics)
* Creative art style, no need to be pretty
* Game has a main map (Media Town) and a cruel map (Wasteland)
* There are different places to visit in each map, like home, bank, shop etc.

The Goal:
* Change Media Town from a politically correct place to a place where people can have a heart.

Game Mechanics:
* Visual Novel (choice based)
* Level based game play in a open world like Stardew Valley or something
* 2 meters: Social Acceptance and Sanity:
*   Social Acceptance: affects stats to interact with people (item price, access to some area etc), if too low player will be exalted to a "Wasteland" map.
*   Sanity: the player's HP, if too low, player will become a "social zombie" and the game is over.
*   choices in the game will affect both stats, often in opposite result.
*   at the end of each level (or chapter), there will be a "finale" event, each time player triggers an event, the world will change to be less politically correct.
*   Player is able to see the "Politically correct (PC) meter" of the world to see what they can do at the current stage
*   World changes will be listed under the PC meter.
